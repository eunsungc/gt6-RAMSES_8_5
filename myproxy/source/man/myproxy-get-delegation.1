.SH NAME
myproxy-logon \- retrieve a credential
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B myproxy-logon
[
.I options
]
.P
.B myproxy-get-delegation
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B myproxy-logon
command retrieves a proxy credential from the
.BR myproxy-server (8)
that was previously stored using
.BR myproxy-init (1)
or
.BR myproxy-store (1).
It can also be used to retrieve short-lived end entity credentials
from a 
.BR myproxy-server (8)
configured to act as a Certificate Authority.
In the default mode, the command prompts for the 
MyProxy pass phrase associated with the credential to be retrieved and
stores the retrieved credential in
the location specified by the
.B X509_USER_PROXY environment variable
or 
.I /tmp/x509up_u<uid>
if that environment variable is not set.
.PP
The
.B myproxy-logon
command is also available under the name 
.B myproxy-get-delegation
for backward compatibility.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h, --help
Displays command usage text and exits.
.TP
.B -u, --usage
Displays command usage text and exits.
.TP
.B -v, --verbose
Enables verbose debugging output to the terminal.
.TP
.B -V, --version
Displays version information and exits.
.TP
.BI -s " hostname[:port], " --pshost " hostname[:port]"
Specifies the hostname(s) of the myproxy-server(s).
Multiple hostnames, each hostname optionally followed by a ':' and port number,
may be specified in a comma-separated list.
This option is required if the
.B MYPROXY_SERVER
environment variable is not defined.  If specified, this option
overrides the
.B MYPROXY_SERVER
environment variable. If a port number is specified with a hostname, it will
override the -p option as well as the
.B MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT
environment variable for that host.
.TP
.BI -p " port, " --psport " port"
Specifies the TCP port number of the
.BR myproxy-server (8).
Default: 7512
.TP
.BI -l " username, " --username " username"
Specifies the MyProxy account under which the credential to retrieve is
stored.  By default, the command uses the value of the
.B LOGNAME
environment variable.
Use this option to specify a different account username on the MyProxy
server.
The MyProxy username need not correspond to a real Unix username.
.TP
.B -d, --dn_as_username
Use the certificate subject (DN) as the default username, instead
of the 
.B LOGNAME 
environment variable.  When used with the
.B -a
option, the certificate subject of the authorization credential is
used.  Otherwise, the certificate subject of the default credential is
used.
.TP
.BI -t " hours, " --proxy_lifetime " hours"
Specifies the lifetime of credentials retrieved from the
.BR myproxy-server (8)
using the stored credential.  The resulting lifetime is the shorter of
the requested lifetime and the lifetime specified when the credential
was stored using
.BR myproxy-init (1).
Default: 12 hours
.TP
.BI -o " file, " --out " file"
Specifies where the retrieved proxy credential should be stored.  If
this option is not specified, the proxy credential will be stored in
the location specified by the
.B X509_USER_PROXY
environment variable or 
.I /tmp/x509up_u<uid>
if that environment variable is not set.
To write the credential to the command's standard output rather than
to a file, use
.B -o
.BR - .
.TP
.BI -a " file, " --authorization " file"
Use this option to
specify an existing, valid credential that you want to renew.
Renewing a credential generally requires two certificate-based
authentications.  The client authenticates with its identity, using
the credential in the standard location or specified by the
.B X509_USER_PROXY
or
.B X509_USER_CERT
and
.B X509_USER_KEY
environment variables
in addition to authenticating with the existing credential, in the
location specified by this option, that it wants to renew.
.TP
.BI -k " name, " --credname " name"
Specifies the name of the credential that is to be retrieved or renewed.
.TP
.B -S, --stdin_pass
By default, the command prompts for a passphrase and reads the
passphrase from the active tty.  When running the command
non-interactively, there may be no associated tty.  Specifying this
option tells the command to read passphrases from standard input
without prompts or confirmation.
.TP
.B -n, --no_passphrase
Don't prompt for a credential passphrase.
Use other methods for authentication, such as Kerberos ticket
or X.509 certificate.
This option is implied by
.B -a
since passphrase authentication is not used for credential renewal.
.TP
.B -T, --trustroots
Retrieve CA certificates directory from server (if available) to store
in the location specified by the
.B X509_CERT_DIR
environment variable if set or
.I /etc/grid-security/certificates
if running as root or
.I ~/.globus/certificates
if running as non-root.
.TP
.B -b, --bootstrap
Unless this option is specified, then if the
.B X509_CERT_DIR 
exists and the CA that signed the
.BR myproxy-server (8)
certificate is not trusted, 
.B myproxy-logon
will fail with an error,
to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
If, however, this option is specified,
.B myproxy-logon
will accept the CA to bootstrap trust.
This option implies 
.BR -T .
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
Only write output messages on error.
.TP
.B -N, --no_credentials
Authenticate only.  Don't retrieve credentials.
.TP
.BI -m " voms, "  --voms " voms"
Add VOMS attributes to the credential by running
.B voms-proxy-init
on the client-side after retrieving the credential from the
.BR myproxy-server (8).
The VOMS VO name must be provided,
as required by
.BR "voms-proxy-init -voms" .
The
.B voms-proxy-init
command must also be installed and configured to use this option.
For example, the
.B VOMS_USERCONF
environment variable may need to be set for 
.B voms-proxy-init
to run correctly.
.TP
.BI -Q " file, "  --certreq " file"
Specify the path to a PEM formatted certificate request to use when
requesting a certificate from the 
.BR myproxy-server (8),
rather than allowing 
.B myproxy-logon
to generate the private key and certificate request itself.
In this case,
.B myproxy-logon
will not output a private key but will only output the signed
certificate and (as needed) certificate chain.
To read the certificate request from standard input rather than
from a file, use
.B -Q
.BR - .
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
0 on success, >0 on error
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATIBILITY
This client will, by default, perform a reverse-DNS lookup to determine
the FQHN (Fully Qualified Host Name) to use in verifying the identity
of the server by checking the FQHN against the CN in server's certificate.
Setting this variable to
.B STRICT_RFC2818
will cause the reverse-DNS lookup to NOT be performed
and the user-specified name to be used instead.
This variable setting will be ignored if
.B MYPROXY_SERVER_DN
(described later) is set.
.TP
.B MYPROXY_SERVER
Specifies the hostname(s) where the
.BR myproxy-server (8)
is running. Multiple hostnames can be specified in a comma separated list with
each hostname optionally followed by a ':' and port number.  This environment
variable can be used in place of the
.B -s
option.
.TP
.B MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT
Specifies the port where the
.BR myproxy-server (8)
is running.  This environment variable can be used in place of the 
.B -p
option.
.TP
.B MYPROXY_SERVER_DN
Specifies the distinguished name (DN) of the 
.BR myproxy-server (8).
All MyProxy client programs authenticate the server's identity.
By default, MyProxy servers run with host credentials, so the MyProxy
client programs expect the server to have a distinguished name with
"/CN=host/<fqhn>" or "/CN=myproxy/<fqhn>" or "/CN=<fqhn>"
(where <fqhn> is the fully-qualified hostname of
the server).  If the server is running with some other DN, you can set
this environment variable to tell the MyProxy clients to accept the
alternative DN. Also see
.B GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATIBILITY
above.
.TP
.B MYPROXY_TCP_PORT_RANGE
Specifies a range of valid port numbers 
in the form "min,max"
for the client side of the network connection to the server.
By default, the client will bind to any available port.
Use this environment variable to restrict the ports used to
a range allowed by your firewall.
If unset, MyProxy will follow the setting of the
.B GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
environment variable.
.TP
.B X509_USER_CERT
Specifies a non-standard location for the certificate to be used for
authentication to the 
.BR myproxy-server (8).
.TP
.B X509_USER_KEY
Specifies a non-standard location for the private key to be used for
authentication to the 
.BR myproxy-server (8).
.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
Specifies a non-standard location for the proxy credential to be used
for authentication to the 
.BR myproxy-server (8).
Also specifies the output location for the proxy credential to be
retrieved from the
.BR myproxy-server (8)
unless the 
.B -o
option is given.
.TP
.B X509_CERT_DIR
Specifies a non-standard location for the CA certificates directory.
.TP
.B MYPROXY_KEYBITS
Specifies the size for RSA keys generated by MyProxy.
By default, MyProxy generates 2048 bit RSA keys.
Set this environment variable to "1024" for 1024 bit RSA keys.
