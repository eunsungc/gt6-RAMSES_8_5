README.gpt
==========
This is the README file for the GPT package that contains the GSI-OpenSSH code.
The only thing of use in this file at this time discusses the build-time
configuration possible through the use of the GPT macro system.

As part of the build process for the GPT package, we have decided to make greater
use of the "macro" feature of GPT to minimize the number of changes to the
underlying configure script.  This means that there will be a recommended set of
configure options on a "per-platform" basis, and that you will specify these on
the command-line to gpt-build as in:

    $GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build gsi_openssh-<version>-src.tar.gz gcc32 \
      GSI_OPENSSH_GPTMACRO="<configureOptions>"

options used in this release.
