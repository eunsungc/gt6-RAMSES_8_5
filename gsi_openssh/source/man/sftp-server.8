[\fB\-ehR\fP]
[\fB\-d\fP \fIstart_directory\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsftp-server\fP
is a program that speaks the server side of SFTP protocol
to stdout and expects client requests from stdin.
\fBsftp-server\fP
is not intended to be called directly, but from
\fBsshd\fP(8)
using the
\fBSubsystem\fP
option.

Command-line flags to
\fBsftp-server\fP
should be specified in the
\fBSubsystem\fP
declaration.
See
\fBsshd_config\fP(5)
for more information.

Valid options are:
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIstart_directory\fP
specifies an alternate starting directory for users.
The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime:
%% is replaced by a literal '%',
%h is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated,
and %u is replaced by the username of that user.
The default is to use the user's home directory.
This option is useful in conjunction with the
\fBsshd_config\fP(5)
\fBChrootDirectory\fP
option.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
Causes
\fBsftp-server\fP
to print logging information to stderr instead of syslog for debugging.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP \fIlog_facility\fP
Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages from
\fB.\fP
The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
The default is AUTH.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Displays
\fBsftp-server\fP
usage information.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlog_level\fP
Specifies which messages will be logged by
\fB.\fP
The possible values are:
QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that
\fBsftp-server\fP
performs on behalf of the client.
DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.
DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output.
The default is ERROR.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
Places this instance of
\fBsftp-server\fP
into a read-only mode.
Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations that change
the state of the filesystem, will be denied.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP \fIumask\fP
Sets an explicit
\fBumask\fP(2)
to be applied to newly-created files and directories, instead of the
user's default mask.

For logging to work,
\fBsftp-server\fP
must be able to access
\fI/dev/log\fP.
Use of
\fBsftp-server\fP
in a chroot configuration therefore requires that
\fBsyslogd\fP(8)
establish a logging socket inside the chroot directory.
