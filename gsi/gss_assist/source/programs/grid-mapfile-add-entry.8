.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
program adds a new mapping from an X\&.509 distinguished name to a local POSIX user name to a gridmap file\&. Gridmap files are used as a simple authorization method for services such as GRAM5 or GridFTP\&.
.PP
The
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
program verifies that the
\fILOCAL\-NAME\fR
is a valid user name on the system on which it was run, and that the mapping between
\fIDISTINGUISHED\-NAME\fR
and
\fILOCAL\-NAME\fR
does not already exist in the gridmap file\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
will modify the gridmap file named by the
\fBGRIDMAP\fR
environment variable if present, or the file
/etc/grid\-security/grid\-mapfile
if not\&. This can be changed by the use of the
\fB\-mapfile\fR
or
\fB\-f\fR
command\-line options\&.
.PP
If the gridmap file does not exist,
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
will create it\&. If it already exists,
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
will save the current contents of the file to a new file with the string
\&.old
appended to the file name\&.
.PP
The full set of command\-line options to
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
are:
.PP
\fB\-help\fR, \fB\-usage\fR
.RS 4
Display the command\-line options to
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-version\fR, \fB\-versions\fR
.RS 4
Display the version number of the
\fBgrid\-mapfile\-add\-entry\fR
command\&. The second form includes more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-dn \fR\fB\fIDISTINGUISHED\-NAME\fR\fR
.RS 4
The X\&.509 distinguished name to add a mapping for\&. The name should be in OpenSSL\'s
oneline
format\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-ln \fR\fB\fILOCAL\-NAME\fR\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR
.RS 4
The POSIX user name to map the distinguished name to\&. This name must be a valid username\&. Add multiple
\fILOCAL\-NAME\fR
strings after the
\fB\-ln\fR
command\-line option\&. If any of the local names are invalid, no changes will be made to the gridmap file\&. Note that if multiple occurances of the
\fB\-ln\fR
command\-line option are present, only the the last one will be added\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-dryrun\fR
.RS 4
Verify local names and display diagnostics about what would be added to the gridmap file, but don\'t actually modify the file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-mapfile \fR\fB\fIMAPFILE\fR\fR, \fB\-f \fR\fB\fIMAPFILE\fR\fR
.RS 4
Modify the gridmap file named by
\fIMAPFILE\fR

.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
