NAME
----
grid-ca-sign - Sign a certificate with a SimpleCA for use on a grid

[[grid-ca-sign-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*grid-ca-sign* -in 'REQUEST' -out 'CERTIFICATE' [OPTIONS]

*grid-ca-sign* [ -help | -h | -usage | -version | -versions ]

[[grid-ca-sign-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-ca-sign* program signs a certificate based on a request file with a CA
certificate created by *grid-ca-create*. The new
certificate is written to a file. If the CA has already signed a
certificate with the same subject name as contained in the certificate
request, it will refuse to sign the new request unless the
'-force' option is provided on the command-line.

If run as a privileged user, *grid-ca-sign* uses the CA certificate and
configuration located in +${localstatedir}/lib/globus/simple_ca+ to
sign the certificate. For a non-privileged user, *grid-ca-sign* uses the CA
certificate and configuration located in +$HOME/.globus/simpleCA+. The
*grid-ca-sign* program an use a different CA configuration and certificate by
using the '-dir' option.
