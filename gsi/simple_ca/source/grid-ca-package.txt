NAME
----
grid-ca-package - Prepare a CA certificate, configuration, and policy for distribution

[[grid-ca-package-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*grid-ca-sign* [-ca 'HASH'] [-g] [-b] [-r] [-d]

*grid-ca-sign* [ -help| -h| -usage| -version| -versions ]

[[grid-ca-package-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-ca-sign* utility creates a tarball containing an RPM spec file and
the files needed to use a CA with grid tools. It optionally will also
create a GPT package for distributing a CA.

By default, the *grid-ca-sign* utility displays a list of installed grid CA and
prompts for which CA to package. It then creates a tarball containing the CA
certificate, signing policy, CA configuration files, and an spec script to
generate a binary RPM package containing the CA. If the CA hash is known prior
to running *grid-ca-sign*, it may provided as an argument to the
'-ca' parameter to avoid prompting.

In addition to generating a spec script and tarball, *grid-ca-sign* creates a
GPT package if either the '-g' or '-b' options
are used on the command-line. These packages may be used to distribute a CA and
configuration to systems which do not support RPM packages.

The *grid-ca-sign* utility writes the package tarballs to the current working
directory.

[[grid-ca-package-OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
-------
The full set of command-line options to *grid-ca-sign* follows:

*-help, -h, -usage*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-ca-sign* and
    exit.
*-version, -versions*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-ca-sign* command. The second form
    includes more details.
*-ca 'CA'*::
    Use the CA whose name matches the hash string 'CA'. When invoked with this
    option, *grid-ca-sign* runs non-interactively.
*-g*::
    Create a GPT binary package in addition to the RPM script tarball. This
    package may be installed on other systems using the
    *gpt-install* program.
*-b*::
    Create a GPT binary package with GPT metadata located in the path expected
    by GPT 3.2 (used in Globus 2.0.0-5.0.x) instead of
    +${datadir}/globus/packages+ as used in Globus 5.2.x. This option
    overrides the '-g' command-line option.
*-r*::
    Create a binary RPM package for the CA. This option currently only works on
    RPM-based distributions.
*-d*::
    Create a binary Debian package for the CA.  This option currently only
    works on Debian-based distributions.
