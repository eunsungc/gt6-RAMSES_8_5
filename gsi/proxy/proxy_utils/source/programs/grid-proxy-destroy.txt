SYNOPSIS

grid-proxy-destroy -help | -usage | -version

grid-proxy-destroy [-debug] [-dryrun] [-default] [-- FILENAME ...]

[[grid-proxy-destroy-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The grid-proxy-destroy program removes X.509 proxy files from the local
filesystem.  It overwrites the data in the files and removes the files from the
filesystem. By default, it removes the current user's default proxy (either
+/tmp/x509up_u'UID'+ where 'UID' is the current POSIX user id, or
the file pointed to by the +X509_USER_PROXY+ environment
variable) unless a list of proxy file paths are included as part of
the command line.

Use the *--* command-line option to separate a
list of proxy paths from command line options if the proxy file
begins with the *-* character.
