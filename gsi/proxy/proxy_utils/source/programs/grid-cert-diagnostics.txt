== NAME ==
grid-cert-diagnostics - Print diagnostic information about certificates and keys

[[grid-cert-diagnostics-SYNOPSIS]]
== SYNOPSIS ==
*grid-cert-diagnostics* [ -h | -help ]

*grid-cert-diagnostics* [ -p ] [ -n ] [ -c CERTIFICATE ]

*grid-cert-diagnostics* [ -s HOST[:PORT] | -g HOST[:PORT] ]

[[grid-cert-diagnostics-DESCRIPTION]]
== DESCRIPTION ==
The *grid-cert-diagnostics* program displays information about
the current user's security environment, including information about
security-related environment variables, security directory search path, personal
key and certificates, and trusted certificates. It is intended to provide 
information to help diagnose problems using GSIC.

By default, *grid-cert-diagnostics* prints out information regarding the
environment and trusted certificate directory. If the '-p'
command-line option is used, then additional information about the current
user's default certificate and key will be printed.

The *grid-cert-diagnostics* program can also attempt do diagnose problems
connecting to remote GridFTP or SSL-based services.

[[grid-cert-diagnostics-OPTIONS]]
== OPTIONS ==
The full set of command-line options to *grid-cert-diagnostics* consists of:

*-h, -help*::
    Display a help message and exit.

*-p*::
    Display information about the personal certificate and key that is the
    current user's default credential.

*-n*::
    Check time synchronization with the `ntpdate` command.

*-c 'CERTIFICATE', -c '-'*::
    Check the validity of the certificate in the file named by 'CERTIFICATE' or
    standard input if the parameter to '-c' is '-'.

*-s 'HOST[:PORT]'*::
    Connect to the service listening on 'HOST:PORT' and initiate the TLS
    protocol. Diagnostics will be printed containing the TLS / SSL protocol 
    version and available cipher list. The certificate chain will be verified,
    and certificate subject name, issuer name, and subjectAltName extensions
    will be printed. If the ':PORT' is omitted, the default of '443' is used.

*-g 'HOST[:PORT]'*::
    Similar to the '-s' option, but use the GridFTP protocol. The
    initial GridFTP banner response is included in the diagnostic output.
    If the ':PORT' is omitted, the default of '2811' is used.

[[grid-cert-diagnostics-EXAMPLES]]
== EXAMPLES ==
In this example, we see the default mode of checking the default security
environment for the system, without processing the user's key and certificate.
Note the user receives a warning about a +cog.properties+
and about an expired CA certificate.
