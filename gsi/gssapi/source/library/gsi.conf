# GSSAPI Name compatiblity mode when trying to determine
# if a host certificate is legitimate. GSI predates RFC2818,
# so there are some old, less-secure, practices by default.
# The different modes are:
# STRICT_GT2:
#     Strictly backward-compatible with GT 2.0 name matching. 
#     X.509 subjectAltName values are ignored. Names with
#     hyphens are treated as wildcarded such that 
#     host-ANYTHING.example.com will match a certificate named
#     host.example.com. The name matching will rely on canonical
#     host (as resolved via getnameinfo) name associated with
#     a connection's IP addresses.
# STRICT_RFC2818:
#     Support RFC 2818 server identity processing. Hyphen 
#     characters are treated as normal part of a host name. 
#     dnsName and ipAddress subjectAltName extensions are matched
#     against the host and port passed to GSSAPI. If subjectAltName 
#     is present, X.509 SubjectName is ignored. 
# HYBRID:
#     Support a hybrid of the two previous name matching algorithms,
#     liberally matching both hyphen wildcards, canonical names
#     associated with IP addresses, and subjectAltName extensions.
#     This has been the default since GT 4.2

# order instead of the cipher order presented by the client. When not set, the
# SSL server will always follow the clients preferences.
