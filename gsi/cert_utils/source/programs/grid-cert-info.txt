NAME

grid-cert-info - Display information about a certificate

[[grid-cert-info-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*grid-cert-info* '-help' | '-usage' | '-version' | '-versions'

*grid-cert-info* OPTIONS

[[grid-cert-info-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-cert-info* program displays information contained within a
certificate file. By default it shows a text representation of the entire
certificate.  Specific facts about the certificate can be shown instead by
using command-line options. If any of those options are used, then the default
display is suppressed. This can be added to the output by using the '-all'
command-line option.

If multiple display options are included on the command-line, the facts
related to those will be displayed on separate lines in the order that
they occur. If an option is specified multiple time, that fact will
be displayed multiple times.

[[grid-cert-info-OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
-------
The full set of command-line options to *grid-cert-info* are:

*-help, -usage*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-cert-info* and exit.
*-version, -versions*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-cert-info* command. The second form
    includes more details.
*-file 'CERTIFICATE-FILE'*::
    Display information about the first certificate contained in the file named
    by 'CERTIFICATE-FILE' instead of the default user certificate.
*-rfc2253*::
    Display X.509 distinguished names using the string representation defined
    in RFC 2253 instead of the default OpenSSL 'oneline' format.
*-all*::
    Display the text representation of the entire certificate in addition to
    any other facts requested by command-line options. This is the default if
    no fact-specific command-line options are used.
*-subject, -s*::
    Display the subject name of the X.509 certificate.
*-issuer, -i*::
    Display the issuer name of the X.509 certificate.
*-issuerhash, -ih*::
    Display the default hash of the issuer name of the X.509 certificate. This
    can be used to locate which CA certificate in the trusted certificate
    directory issued the certificate being inspected.
*-startdate, -sd*::
    Display a string representation of the date and time when the certificate
    is valid from. This is displayed in the format used by the OpenSSL
    *x509* command.
*-enddate, -ed*::
    Display a string representation of the date and time when the certificate
    is valid until. This is displayed in the format used by the OpenSSL
    *x509* command.
