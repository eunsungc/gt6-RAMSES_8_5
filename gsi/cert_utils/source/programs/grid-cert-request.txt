[[grid-cert-request-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-cert-request* program generates an X.509 Certificate Request and
corresponding private key for the specified name, host, or service. It is
intended to be used with a CA implemented using the
*globus_simple_ca* package.

The default behavior of *grid-cert-request* is to generate a certificate
request and private key for the user running the command. The subject name is
derived from the gecos information in the local system's password database,
unless the '-commonname', '-cn', or '-host' command-line options are used.

By default, *grid-cert-request* writes user certificate requests and keys to
the +$HOME/.globus+ directory, and host and service certificate requests and
keys to +/etc/grid-security+. This can be overridden by using the 
'-dir' command-line option.

[[grid-cert-request-OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
-------
The full set of command-line options to *grid-cert-request* are:

*-help, -h, -?, -usage*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-cert-request* and
    exit.
*-version, -versions*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-cert-request* command. The second
    form includes more details.
*-cn 'NAME', -commonname 'NAME'*::
Create a certificate request with the common name component of the subject set
to 'NAME'. This is used to create user identity
certificates.
*-dir 'DIRECTORY'*::
    Write the certificate request and key to files in the directory specified
    by 'DIRECTORY'.
*-prefix 'PREFIX'*::
    Use the string 'PREFIX' as the base name of the certificate,
    certificate_request, and key files instead of the default. For a user
    certificate request, this would mean creating files
    +$HOME/.globus/'PREFIX'cert_request.pem+, +$HOME/.globus/'PREFIX'cert.pem+,
    and +$HOME/.globus/'PREFIX'key.pem+.
*-ca 'CA-HASH'*::
    Use the certificate request configuration for the CA with the name hash
    'CA-HASH' instead of the default CA chosen by running
    *grid-default-ca*.
*-verbose*::
    Keep the output from the OpenSSL certificate request command visible after
    it completes, instead of clearing the screen.
*-interactive, -int*::
    Prompt for each component of the subject name of the request, instead of
    generating the common name from other command-line options. Note that CAs
    may not sign certificates for subject names that don't match their signing
    policies.
*-force*::
    Overwrite any existing certificate request and private key with a new
    one.
*-nopw, -nodes, -nopassphrase*::
    Create an unencrypted private key for the certificate instead of prompting
    for a passphrase. This is the default behavior for host or service
    certificates, but not recommended for user certificates.
*-host 'FQDN'*::
    Create a certificate request for use on a particular host. This option also
    causes the private key associated with the certificate request to be
    unencrypted. The 'FQDN' argument to this option should be the fully
    qualified domain name of the host that will use this certificate. The
    subject name of the certificate will be derived from the 'FQDN' and the
    service option if specified by the '-service' command-line
    option. If the host for the certificate has multiple names, then use either
    the '-dns' or '-ip' command-line options to add alternate names or
    addresses to the certificates.
*-service 'SERVICE'*::
    Create a certificate request for a particular service on a host. The
    subject name of the certificate will be derived from the 'FQDN' passed as
    the argument to the '-host' command-line option and the 'SERVICE' string.
*-dns 'FQDN,...'*::
    Create a certificate request containing a +subjectAltName+ extension
    containing one or more host names. This is used when a certificate may be
    used by multiple virtual servers or if a host has different names when
    contacted within or outside a private network. Multiple DNS names can be
    included in the extension by separating then with a
    comma.
*-ip 'IP-ADDRESS,...'*::
    Create a certificate request containing a +subjectAltName+
    extension containing the IP addresses named by the 'IP-ADDRESS' strings.
    This is used when a certificate may be used by services listening on
    multiple networks. Multiple IP addresses can be included in the extension
    by separating then with a comma.

[[grid-cert-request-EXAMPLES]]
EXAMPLES
--------
Create a user certificate request:
    % *grid-cert-request*
    A certificate request and private key is being created.
    You will be asked to enter a PEM pass phrase.
    This pass phrase is akin to your account password, 
    and is used to protect your key file.
    If you forget your pass phrase, you will need to
    obtain a new certificate.
    A private key and a certificate request has been generated with the subject:

    /O=org/OU=example/OU=grid/CN=Joe User

    If the CN=Joe User is not appropriate, rerun this
    script with the -force -cn "Common Name" options.

    Your private key is stored in /home/juser/.globus/userkey.pem
    Your request is stored in /home/juser/.globus/usercert_request.pem

    Please e-mail the request to the Example CA ca@grid.example.org
    You may use a command similar to the following:

      cat /home/juser/.globus/usercert_request.pem | mail ca@grid.example.org

    Only use the above if this machine can send AND receive e-mail. if not, please
    mail using some other method.

    Your certificate will be mailed to you within two working days.
If you receive no response, contact Example CA at ca@grid.example.org

Create a host certificate for a host with two names.

    % *grid-cert-request -host grid.example.org -dns grid.example.org,grid-internal.example.org*
    A private host key and a certificate request has been generated
    with the subject:

    /O=org/OU=example/OU=grid/CN=host/grid.example.org

    ----------------------------------------------------------

    The private key is stored in /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
    The request is stored in /etc/grid-security/hostcert_request.pem

    Please e-mail the request to the Example CA ca@grid.example.org
    You may use a command similar to the following:

     cat /etc/grid-security/hostcert_request.pem | mail ca@grid.example.org

    Only use the above if this machine can send AND receive e-mail. if not, please
    mail using some other method.

    Your certificate will be mailed to you within two working days.
    If you receive no response, contact Example CA at
    ca@grid.example.org

[[grid-cert-request-ENVIRONMENT]]
ENVIRONMENT
-----------
The following environment variables affect the execution of

    Path to the directory containing SSL configuration files for generating
    certificate requests.

    Path to the directory containing SSL configuration files for generating
    certificate requests. This value is used if +X509_CERT_DIR+ is
    not set.
*GLOBUS_LOCATION*::
    Path to the directory containing the Globus Toolkit. This is searched if
    neither the +X509_CERT_DIR+ nor the +GRID_SECURITY_DIR+ environment
    variables are set.
