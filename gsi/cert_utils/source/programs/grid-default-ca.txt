grid-default-ca - Select default CA for certificate requests

[[grid-default-ca-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS

*grid-default-ca* -help | -h | -usage | -u | -version | -versions

*grid-default-ca* [-ca 'CA-HASH' | -list ] [OPTIONS]

[[grid-default-ca-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-default-ca* program sets the default certificate authority to use when
the *grid-cert-request* script is run. The CA's certificate, configuration, and
signing policy must be installed in the trusted certificate directory to be
able to request certificates from that CA. Note that some CAs have different
policies and use other tools to handle certificate requests. Please consult
your CA's support staff if you unsure. The *grid-default-ca* is designed to
work with CAs implemented using the *globus_simple_ca* package.

By default, the *grid-default-ca* program displays a list of installed CA
certificates and the prompts the user for which one to set as the default. If
invoked with the '-list' command-line option, *grid-default-ca* will print the
list and not prompt nor set the default CA. If invoked with the
'-ca' option, it will not list or prompt, but set the default CA
to the one with the hash that matches the 'CA-HASH'
argument to that option. If *grid-default-ca* is used to set the default CA,
the caller of this program must have write permissions to the trusted
certificate directory.

The *grid-default-ca* program sets the CA in the one of the grid security
directories.  It looks in the directory named by the
+GRID_SECURITY_DIR+ environment, the +X509_CERT_DIR+ environment,
+/etc/grid-security+ and +$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/certificates+.

The full set of command-line options to *grid-default-ca* are:

*-help, -h, -usage, -u*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-default-ca* and
    exit.
*-version, -versions*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-default-ca* command. The second
    form includes more details.
*-dir 'CA-DIRECTORY'*::
    Use the trusted certificate directory named by
    'CA-DIRECTORY' instead of the default.
*-list*::
    Instead of changing the default CA, print out a list of all available CA
    certificates in the trusted certificate directory.
*-ca 'CA-HASH'*::
    Set the default CA without displaying the list of choices or prompting. The

[[grid-default-ca-EXAMPLES]]
EXAMPLES
--------
List the contents of the trusted certificate directory that contain
the string Example:
    
    % grid-default-ca | grep Example
    15) cd1186ff -  /DC=org/DC=Example/DC=Grid/CN=Example CA

Choose that CA as the default:
    
    % grid-default-ca -ca cd1186ff
    setting the default CA to: /DC=org/DC=Example/DC=Grid/CN=Example CA
    linking /etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-security.conf.cd1186ff to
            /etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-security.conf
    linking /etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-host-ssl.conf.cd1186ff  to
            /etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-host-ssl.conf
    linking /etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-user-ssl.conf.cd1186ff  to
            /etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-user-ssl.conf
    ...done.

[[grid-default-ca-ENVIRONMENT]]
ENVIRONMENT
-----------
The following environment variables affect the execution of *grid-default-ca*:
*GRID_SECURITY_DIRECTORY*::
    Path to the default trusted certificate directory.
*X509_CERT_DIR*::
    Path to the default trusted certificate directory.
*GLOBUS_LOCATION*::
    Path to the Globus Toolkit installation directory.

[[grid-default-ca-BUGS]]
BUGS
----
The *grid-default-ca* program displays CAs from all of the directories in its
search list; however, *grid-cert-request* only uses the first 
which contains a grid security configuration.

The *grid-default-ca* program may display the same CA multiple times if it is
located in multiple directories in its search path. However, it does not
provide any information about which one would actually be used by the
*grid-cert-request* command.
