/**
 * @defgroup globus_priority_q Priority Queue
 * @ingroup globus_common
 *
 * @details
 * This module defines a priority queue for globus.
 * It is implemented using a binary heap (minheap) and does NOT have
 * a fifo fallback for like priorities.  If you need fifo fallback,
 * you should use a compound priority with the primary priority being
 * the 'real' priority and the secondary being a serial number.
 *
 * To use this priority queue type, define a comparison function of type
 * globus_priority_q_cmp_func_t and pass that to globus_priority_q_init().
 * 
 * To add and remove items in priority order, use
 * globus_priority_q_enqueue() and globus_priority_q_dequeue() respectively.
 *
 * To remove a datum ignoring its priority, use globus_priority_q_remove().
 *
 * To inspect the first element and its priority, use globus_priority_q_first()
 * and globus_priority_q_first_priority() respectively.
 *
 * To determine whether a queue is empty or the number of data in it, use
 * globus_priority_q_empty() and globus_priority_q_size().
 *
 * To modify the priority of a datum already in the queue, use
 * globus_priority_q_modify().
 *
 * When finished with the queue, use globus_priority_q_destroy() to free data
 * associated with the priority queue.

/**
 * @brief Priority Comparison Predicate
 * @ingroup globus_priority_q
 * @details
 * This type is used to implement comparison of two priorities for inserting
 * items into the priority queue. A function of this type is passed to 
 * globus_priority_q_init() to determine how priorities are computed in a newly
 * created priority queue.
 *
 * @param priority_1
 *     First priority to compare
 * @param priority_2
 *     Second priority to compare
 *
 * @retval > 0
 *     The priority of priority_1 is less than that of priority_2.
 * @retval < 0
 *     The priority of priority_1 is greater than that of priority_2.
 * @retval = 0
 *     The priorities of priority_1 and priority_2 are the same.
