# Description:  This is the multi-host XDD data movement script.  If you want 
# to move a file from a single source to a single destination, you probably 
# want xddcp.  The xddcp script works similarly to bbcp and scp, it just drives 
# the disk alot faster.  But if you're here, then you want to go faster than 
# a single host can drive.
