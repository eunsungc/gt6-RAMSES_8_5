To run the acceptance tests for XDD, you must first create a test_config based
on the contents of test_config.example. 

Acceptance tests belong in the "acceptance" directory.  Unit tests belong in the
"unit" directory.  Other tests are stored in the "other" directory.

Test output is stored in the output directory.
