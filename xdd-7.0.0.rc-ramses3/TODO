TODO file for XDD

Things that used to work, that I wished still worked:
* Data analysis mode in xddcp.
* Kernel trace analysis mode.
* Data rate throttling.

Things that work now, but are hard to understand:
* The output format stuff is tricky.
* The difference between request sizes and block sizes is error-prone.
* Some options take number of blocks, others take bytes.  Standardize it.
* Way, way, way too much output by default.

Things that should work:
* Small odd sizes sometimes don't work.
* The parser for XDD core dumps when an option is wrong.
* Some fields in the results data can be wrong when they aren't relevant.

New features:
* Operations on directories.
* Operate with files based on their physical layouts.
* Better Lustre integration.
* Expose more ioctls easily.  Maybe even the ability to time ioctls.
* Complete the separation of xdd and xdd-lite.  That is, no networking
code in xdd, no benchmarking code in xdd-lite.
