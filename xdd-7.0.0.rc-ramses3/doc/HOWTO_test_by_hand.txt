*Assuming you want to test on a pod or a like machine*

From your base xdd source directory:
  - configure and build xdd
  - run: contrib/nightly_build_and_test_pods.sh
    - ignore errors about mkdir

  - edit test_config and change XDDTEST_LOCAL_MOUNT, XDDTEST_SOURCE_MOUNT,
    and XDDTEST_DEST_MOUNT to appropriate directories writable by you

  - run tests/scripts/<scriptname>

Of course, the scripts can be run from any working directory, but there is an
assumption that your current working directory contains the test_config file.
