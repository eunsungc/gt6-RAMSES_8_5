This document describes how to cut a release of the XDD software.
--


Before anything else, Tom, Steve, all get the tree to a place where it 
has the features we think it needs.  This includes modifying the CHANGES 
file so that it contains a summary of what new features the tree should 
contain.

Then perform the following steps:

1.  Retrieve the repository:
	> git clone https://github.com/bws/xdd.git

2.  Increment the version release number for the build.  Versions 
numbers are in the format MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE[.PRE-RELEASE].  This 
is the standard convention for most Linux software packaged and publicly 
available:
	> cd xdd
	> vi configure.ac # and edit the VERSION variable
	> autoconf
	> ./configure --prefix=$HOME/sw/xdd
	> make baseversion
	> make
	> make install
	> xdd -version

3.  Test the new features:
	> ./run_some_tests.sh . . .

4.  If the tests don't pass, we go back to before step 1.  Otherwise, we 
continue cutting the release.

5.  Ensure the ChangeLog is up to date
	> vi ChangeLog

6.  Resolve all conflicts with main repository
	> git commit -a	
	> git push


7.  Tag the code push the tag to the Durmstrang repository..
	> TAG_NAME=xdd-MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE[.PRE-RELEASE]
	> git tag -a ${TAG_NAME}
	> git push --tags

8.  At this point, the release is ready.  It can be retrieved by anyone with 
    access to the repository.  To retrieve the release, run the following command:
	> make dist
    or alternatively if the distribution is US only:
	> make dist-usa

The resulting tar file now contains the released code only.

9.  Prepare for the next release
	> vi configure.ac # And set the version in AC_INIT to pre-nextrelease
	> autoconf
	> git commit -a
	> git push
