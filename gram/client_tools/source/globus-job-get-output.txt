NAME
----
globus-job-get-output - Retrieve the output and error streams from a GRAM job

[[globus-job-get-output-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*globus-job-get-output* [ -r 'RESOURCE' | -resource 'RESOURCE' ] [OPTIONS] 'JOBID'

*globus-job-get-output* [-help | -usage | -version | -versions ]

[[globus-job-get-output-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *globus-job-get-output* program retrieves the output and error streams of
the job named by 'JOBID'. By default, *globus-job-get-output* will retrieve all
output and error data from the job and display them to its own output and error
streams. Other behavior can be controlled by using command-line options.
The data retrieval is implemented by submitting another job which
simply displays the contents of the first job's output and error streams.
By default this retrieval job is submitted to the
default GRAM resource running on the same host as the job. This behavior can be
controlled by specifying a particular resource manager contact string as the
'RESOURCE' parameter to the '-r' or '-resource' option.

*-versions*::
    Display the software version of the *globus-job-get-output* program

*-resource 'RESOURCE', -r 'RESOURCE'*::
    Submit the retrieval job to the resource named by 'RESOURCE' instead of the

*-out*::
    Retrieve only the standard output stream of the job. The default is to
    retrieve both standard output and standard error.

*-err*::
    Retrieve only the standard error stream of the job. The default is to
    retrieve both standard output and standard error.

*-tail 'LINES', -t 'LINES'*::
    Print only the last 'LINES' count lines of output from the data streams
    being retrieved. By default, the entire output and error file data is
    retrieved. This option can not be used along with the '-f' or '-follow'
    options.

*-follow 'LINES', -f 'LINES'*::
    Print the last 'LINES' count lines of output from the data streams being
    retrieved and then wait until canceled, printing any subsequent job output
