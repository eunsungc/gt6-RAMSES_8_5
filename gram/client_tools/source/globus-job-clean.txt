NAME
----
globus-job-clean - Cancel and clean up a GRAM batch job

[[globus-job-clean-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*globus-job-clean* [OPTIONS] 'JOBID'

*globus-job-clean* [ -help | -usage | -version | -versions ]

[[globus-job-clean-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *globus-job-clean* program cancels the job named by 'JOBID' if
it is still running, and then removes any cached files on the GRAM service node
related to that job. In order to do the file clean up, it submits a job which
removes the cache files. By default this cleanup job is submitted to the
default GRAM resource running on the same host as the job. This behavior can be
controlled by specifying a resource manager contact string as the parameter to
the '-r' or '-resource' option.

By default, *globus-job-clean* prompts the user prior to canceling the job.
This behavior can be overridden by specifying the '-f' or
'-force' command-line options.
