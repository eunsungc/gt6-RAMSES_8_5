NAME
----
globus-scheduler-event-generator - Process job state change events

[[globus-scheduler-event-generator-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*globus-scheduler-event-generator* -h

*globus-scheduler-event-generator* -s 'LRM_NAME' [OPTIONS]

[[globus-scheduler-event-generator-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *globus-scheduler-event-generator* (SEG) is a program which uses
local resource manager-specific monitoring modules to generate job state
change events. At the SEG level, the state change events correspond to 
changes in any jobs which are managed by the scheduler, even if they do
not correspond to jobs initiated by the GRAM5 Service. These state
change events are propagated to the Job State Monitor.

Depending on scheduler-specific requirements, the SEG may need to run with 
privileges to enable it to obtain scheduler event
notifications. As such, one SEG runs per scheduler resource. For example,
on a host which provides access to both PBS and fork jobs, two SEGs, running
at (potentially) different privilege levels will be running.

When executed, the SEG is able to start issuing events from some
time in the past. The SEG will, in general, not require any persistent
state between invocations. One SEG instance exists for any particular
scheduled resource instance (one for all homogeneous PBS queues, one for
all fork jobs, etc).

The SEG is implemented in an executable called the
*globus-scheduler-event-generator*, located in the Globus Toolkit's
+sbin+ directory. 

When begun, it loads the LRM-specific module based on the 'LRM_NAME' parameter,
and then defers to it for most functionality. When it detects
an error writing to stdout or reading stdin, it terminates. The LRM-specific
code uses the SEG API to emit events to the GRAM5 service.

[[globus-scheduler-event-generator-author-OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
    Display a help message and exit.
*-s 'LRM_NAME'*::
    Load the LRM-specific module for 'LRM_NAME'. This is translated to
    loading the dynamic library libglobus_seg_'LRM_NAME'.
*-t 'TIMESTAMP'*::
    Process events starting at 'TIMESTAMP'. This is the only way to get the
    globus-scheduler-event-generator to process events that occur before
    the process begins. If not specified, it will generate events from the
    current timestamp only.
*-d 'DIRECTORY'*::
    Write job state change events to files in 'DIRECTORY', named by the day
    that the event occurred (+DIRECTORY/YYYYMMDD+); if not specified, the
    events will be written to standard output.
*-b*::
    Run in the background. This only works if the *-d* option above is used.
*-p 'PIDFILE'*::
    Write the process id of the globus-scheduler-event-generator to 'PIDFILE'.
