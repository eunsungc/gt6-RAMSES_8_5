@page globus_gram_job_manager_script_interface Job Manager Scheduler Interface

The GRAM Job Manager interfaces with the job filesystems and scheduler
through scheduler-specific Perl modules. GRAM provides several Perl modules
which can be used to implement scheduler-specific interfaces to the GRAM Job
Manager. These are:
<dl>
    <dt>
	Globus::GRAM::Error
    </dt>
    <dd>
	This module implements the GRAM error results as objects. Methods
	in this module will construct a GRAM error with the value matching the
	values in the GRAM Protocol library.  A scheduler-specific JobManager
	module may return one of these objects from its methods to indicate
	errors to the Job Manager program.
    </dd>
    <dt>
	Globus::GRAM::JobState
    </dt>
    <dd>
	This module defines the GRAM job state constants. A scheduler-specific
	JobManager module returns one of these values from its methods
	to indicate the managed job's current state.
    </dd>
    <dt>
	Globus::GRAM::JobSignal
    </dt>
    <dd>
	This module defines the GRAM job signal constant values. The Job
	Manager uses these values to communicate which signal is being
	invoked in the manager's signal method.
    </dd>
    <dt>
	Globus::GRAM::JobManager
    </dt>
    <dd>
	This module defines the actual implementatoin of the Job Manager
	scheduler interface. One writing a scheduler-specific GRAM
	interface will create a subclass of this object which overrides the
	default implementation's methods. 
    </dd>
    <dt>
	Globus::GRAM::JobDescription
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This module mimics the RSL job description using perl syntax. The job
	manager passes an object of this type to the JobManager modules's
	constructor. The job manager stores RSL and some configuration values
	in that JobDescription object. The manager accesses values stored in
	the JobDescription by invoking methods containing the RSL attribute's
	name (example: <code>$description-&gt;gram_my_job()</code>). Method names
	are handled as if they were based on the canonical RSL representation
	of the attribute name. For example, the <b>gram_my_job</b> may be 
	equivalently referred to as <b>GramMyJob</b>, <b>grammyjob</b>, or
	<b>GRAM_My_Job</b>.
    </dd>
