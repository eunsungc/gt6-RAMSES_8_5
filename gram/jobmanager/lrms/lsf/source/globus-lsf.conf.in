# For the mpi jobtype, this LRM implementation supports both the
# MPI 2-specified mpiexec command and the non-standard mpirun command common
# in older mpi systems. If either of these is path to an executable, it will
# be used to start the job processes (with mpiexec preferred over mpirun). Set
# to "no" to not use mpiexec or mpirun

mpirun=@MPIRUN@

# The LSF_PROFILE configuration should be set to the path to the profile.lsf
# file which defines the shell environment needed to use LSF. This file
# can be used to find the paths to most LSF programs below.

# The bsub command is used to submit jobs to the lsf resource.

# The bqueues command is used to determine which queues are available to

# The bjobs, bhist, and bacct commands are used to poll jobs for status
# bjobs=@BJOBS@
# bhist=@BHIST@
