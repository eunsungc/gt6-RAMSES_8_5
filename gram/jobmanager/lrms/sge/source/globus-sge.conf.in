# This points to a file which contains definitions of the SGE_CELL and SGE_ROOT

# The Scheduler Event Generator module for SGE requires that the reporting
# file be available for reading. This requires some configuration on the SGE
# side to make it possible to use:
# - SGE must be configured to write information to the reporting file
# - SGE must not load that data inthe ARCo database
# By default, if the Scheduler Event Generator is enabled, it will use
# $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/reporting. To set a specific path, uncomment
# the following line and set the log_path value to the path to the reporting
# file

# Tools for managing GridEngine jobs:

# Parallel environment configuration.
# GridEngine supports different environments to run parallel jobs. There are
# three configuration items which may be used to control how and when these are
# validated.
# - default_pe=ENVIRONMENT
#   If this is set, jobs with no parallel environment defined in the job
#   request, will be submitted using the specified ENVIRONMENT. If this is not
#   set, then parallel jobs will fail if an environment is not present in the
#   RSL
# - available_pes="PE1 PE2..."
#   List of available parallel environments.  If
#   this is not set, the set of parallel environments will be computed by
#   the LRM adapter when it begins execution via the qconf command.
#   If a parallel job is submitted and no parallel environment is
#   specified (either explicitly in RSL or via the default_pe), then the
#   error message will include this list of parallel environments.
# - validate_pes=yes|no
#   If this is set to yes, and the job RSL contains a parallel environment
#   not in the available_pes list, then the LRM interface will reject the job
#   with a message indicating the environment is not supported by GRAM.
#
# default_pe="@MPI_PE@"
validate_pes=@VALIDATE_PES@
# available_pes="@AVAILABLE_PES@"

# Queue configuration
#
# GridEngine supports multiples queues for scheduling jobs. There are
# three configuration items which may be used to control how and when these are
# validated.
# - default_queue=QUEUE
#   If this is set, jobs with no queue defined in the job
#   request will be submitted to the named QUEUE. If this is not
#   set and there is no queue in the job RSL, then GRAM will not set one in
#   the SGE submission script, which may use a site-specific default queue or
#   fail.
# - available_queues="QUEUE1 QUEUE2..."
#   List of available queues. If this is not set, the GRAM SGE adaptor will
#   generate a list of queues when it starts via qconf.
# - validate_queues=yes|no
#   If this is set to yes, then the LRM interface will reject jobs with an
#   error message indicating that the queue is unknown, providing the
#   available_queues values in the error.
