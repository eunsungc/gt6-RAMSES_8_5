# The fork lrm supports using the globus-fork-starter program and the fork
# SEG module to write job state change information to a shared log file. When
# this is used, the job manager can return more accurate state change
# information as well as job exit codes. The downside is shared writable file.
#
# In order to use the fork starter, the job manager must be configured to use
# the fork SEG module by the -seg-module fork option in its configuration file

# For the mpi jobtype, the fork LRM implementation supports both the
# MPI 2-specified mpiexec command and the non-standard mpirun command common
# in older mpi systems. If either of these is path to an executable, it will
# be used to start the job processes (with mpiexec preferred over mpirun). Set
# to "no" to not use mpiexec or mpirun

# The GRAM fork implementation supports softenv as a way to set up environment
# variables for jobs via the softenv RSL attribute. For more information about
# softenv, see
